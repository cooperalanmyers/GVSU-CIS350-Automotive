# Introduction


(In 2-4 paragraphs, describe your project concept)

# Anticipated Technologies
Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+
Inertial Measurement Units
2 Seven Segment LED Displays

# Method/Approach
We are going for a hands on plan of attack, with lots of research and thought before fully diving in. After learning the Pi we will be able to build.

# Estimated Timeline
Week 2 - Pi is up and running (system is good), no major bugs that would prevent Pi exclusively from working
Week 4 - Ensure read/save data from IMU on Pi card (so that all forces are known and we can determine if one part or another is faulty)
Week 6 - Take data and transform it to compass reading/heading

# Anticipated Problems
Raspberry Pi programming and firmware
Library searching for the IMU
